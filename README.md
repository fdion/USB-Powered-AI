# USB-Powered-AI
Encouraging Energy Efficient AI, one USB port at a time

### Goal

It is too easy to brute force a problem with hundreds of servers, each with multiple GPUs. Yawn. Time to move beyond that and start thinking about energy efficiency. Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to run your algorithm (NLP, ML, CV etc) on at most 4.5W of power. In other words, a plain USB 3.0 port.

### Power Limit

Reference is USB 3.0: the limit is six unit loads or 900 mA at 5V, which makes for 4.5W.

### Benchmarks

Coming soon.
